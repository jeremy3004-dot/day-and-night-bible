## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom backend outside Supabase | Existing auth, sync, and SQL-policy architecture already centers on Supabase |
| Full web parity in the current milestone | Mobile reliability is the immediate product focus |
| Realtime chat or video meeting features | High complexity and not required for the core read/listen/discipleship loop |
| Social feed or public community layer | Would broaden the product away from the current study-first value |
