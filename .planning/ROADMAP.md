# Roadmap: EveryBible

## Overview

This roadmap treats EveryBible as a brownfield mobile product that already has most of its feature surface in code, but still needs a disciplined pass to align startup, sync, onboarding, reading/audio polish, learn flows, and release safety. The goal is not to reinvent the app; it is to turn the existing foundation into a coherent, dependable v1.0 baseline that GSD can plan and execute phase by phase.

After the foundation and discovery work, the next Milestone 2 sequence focuses on Dwell-inspired Bible experience parity: richer book hubs, a premium chapter session with synchronized read/listen states, a more complete media-product action model, and companion content around each book.

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**

- Integer phases (1, 2, 3): Planned milestone work

**Depends on**: Phase 05.1
**Requirements**: READ-05, ENG-01, PERF-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can type common references like `John 3:16` or `1 Cor 13` in the Bible surface and open the intended passage directly.

- [x] 06-03: Add a reading-activity calendar surface backed by existing progress state

### Phase 7: Premium Reader And Personal Study

**Goal**: Transform the chapter-level Bible experience into a calm, premium session where reading and listening share context, and listen mode can reveal live follow-along text instead of forcing a separate flow.
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Requirements**: M2-READ-01, M2-AUDIO-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can open a chapter once and switch between `Listen` and `Read` without losing the chapter, verse focus, or playback context.
2. Listen mode exposes a Dwell-style follow-along text surface that auto-scrolls and highlights the current verse or timed text segment from the player chrome.
3. Read mode keeps typography/display controls available without crowding the content, and transitions between the two modes feel intentional rather than like separate screens.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 07-01: Build a shared chapter-session model and segmented read/listen shell
- [x] 07-02: Implement immersive listen mode with follow-along text overlay and synchronized verse focus
- [x] 07-03: Refine read mode typography, controls, and continuity between listen and read

### Phase 8: Bible Book Hub And Chapter Launch Experience

**Goal**: Insert a richer book-detail layer between the book browser and the chapter session so each Bible book has artwork, intro context, a primary play CTA, and clearer launch points into chapters.
**Depends on**: Phase 7
**Requirements**: M2-BROWSE-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Tapping a book from the Bible browser opens a dedicated book hub instead of dropping directly into a plain chapter grid.
2. The book hub can show art, synopsis, intro audio when available, chapter entry points, and resilient empty/loading states when supporting metadata is missing.
3. Launching a chapter from the hub preserves the user's preferred mode and hands off to the shared chapter session cleanly.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 08-01: Define book metadata, artwork, and intro-audio contracts with fallback behavior
- [x] 08-02: Build the book hub screen with hero, synopsis, play CTA, and chapter launch grid
- [x] 08-03: Wire browser-to-hub-to-chapter navigation, resume state, and mini-player handoff

### Phase 9: Saved Library And Audio Personalization

**Goal**: Add the media-product actions that make listening feel owned and resumable: favorites, playlists, sharing, downloads, queue/history, and honest personalization controls for voice or ambient layers where supported.
**Depends on**: Phase 8
**Requirements**: M2-LIB-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. User can favorite, share, download, and save books or chapters to playlists from the listen experience and related overflow menus.
2. User can reopen recent listening from queue/history and control playback from a persistent mini-player outside the immediate reader screen.
3. Voice, translation, and ambient controls communicate availability honestly and never imply options the content layer cannot support.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 09-01: Add local-first saved-item, playlist, and queue/history models for Bible listening
- [x] 09-02: Build player actions and overflow flows for favorite, share, download, and playlist entry
- [x] 09-03: Ship a persistent mini-player plus voice/ambient selection surfaces with fallbacks

### Phase 10: Book Companion Content And Ecosystem Surfaces

**Goal**: Turn book hubs into broader study destinations by attaching Dwell-style companion modules such as passages, devotionals, plans, figures, and playlists through reusable, data-driven sections.
**Depends on**: Phase 9
**Requirements**: M2-CONTENT-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Each book hub can render optional companion modules from a shared contract without breaking when some modules have no content.
2. Users can open book-adjacent passages, devotionals, figures, plans, and playlists from one surface and return without losing their Bible context.
3. The companion content system supports graceful offline/loading/error behavior instead of assuming full connectivity.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 10-01: Define companion-content schema, sourcing rules, and offline cache strategy
- [x] 10-02: Build reusable book-hub sections for passages, devotionals, figures, plans, and playlists
- [x] 10-03: Add analytics and verification coverage for module launch, empty states, and return navigation

### Phase 11: Audio reader chrome simplification and Dwell-style listen layout polish

**Goal**: Make the audio-first Bible chapter screen feel deliberately minimal and Dwell-inspired by removing redundant chrome, explanatory copy, and transport clutter while preserving EveryBible's existing colors and playback behavior.
**Depends on**: Phase 10
**Requirements**: M2-AUDIO-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Audio-first Bible chapters show only the essential listen-shell chrome: back button, `Listen / Read` toggle, overflow actions, cover art, chapter label, progress, and chapter transport.
2. The screen removes redundant elements called out in device feedback, including the top title/version/`AA` bar, 10-second skip buttons, nested shell framing, background icon watermark, and audio-only explanatory copy.
3. The simplified screen keeps current EveryBible colors, does not regress chapter switching or playback continuity, and gains regression coverage plus a focused device QA checklist.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 11-01: Simplify the audio-first reader chrome and remove redundant header/body copy
- [x] 11-02: Rebuild the audio-first transport layout around chapter controls and clean visual shells
- [x] 11-03: Add regression checks and device QA for the simplified Dwell-style listen screen

### Phase 12: Professional Design System Unification

**Goal**: Make EveryBible feel like one intentional product by standardizing typography, spacing, radii, shadows, and semantic colors across the main mobile surfaces.
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: M2-DESIGN-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The app uses one shared mobile design system for typography, spacing, border radius, and elevation instead of screen-by-screen style drift.
2. High-traffic surfaces across Home, Bible browse/book hub, Learn, and More adopt the same professional card, header, and navigation language.
3. Decorative treatments that make the app feel stitched together are removed or simplified so the product reads as calm, structured, and trustworthy at first glance.
   **Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 12-01: Define the app-wide design tokens, palette refinements, and typography hierarchy
- [x] 12-02: Apply the shared design system to the app shell, Home, Bible browse, and book-hub surfaces
- [x] 12-03: Apply the shared design system to Learn, More, Profile, Reading Activity, and shared cards, then verify the sweep

### Phase 12.1: Premium liquid-glass reader chrome and scroll-collapse motion (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Rebuild the read-mode Bible chapter experience around the supplied video so the reader feels premium, glassy, and motion-led instead of like a static screen with attached controls.
**Requirements**: M2-READ-01, M2-DESIGN-01
**Depends on:** Phase 12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Read mode opens in the video-led resting state: top back/segment/overflow glass controls, centered serif chapter hero, and bottom floating glass controls without the old static header or bottom audio bar.
2. Scrolling the chapter collapses the resting chrome into the compact pinned state from the video, including disappearing top controls and shrinking bottom controls down to a centered chapter pill.
3. The redesign keeps current read/listen session continuity and adds regression coverage for the new collapse model, glass chrome, and read-mode control placement.
   **Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [x] 12.1-01: Define the premium reader motion model and visual contract from the supplied video
- [x] 12.1-02: Rebuild the read-mode BibleReader chrome with liquid-glass surfaces and scroll-collapse animation
- [x] 12.1-03: Lock the redesign with regression coverage, verification, and release readiness

### Phase 05.1: Audio-only downloadable Bible experience (INSERTED)

**Goal:** Add a first-class audio-only Bible test path so users can download and listen even when chapter text is unavailable.
**Requirements**: READ-04, AUDIO-03, AUDIO-04
**Depends on:** Phase 5
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. A selectable audio-only translation exists in-app and intentionally has no chapter text while retaining audio playback/download support.
2. Reader and daily-scripture surfaces present clear audio-first/no-text states instead of generic missing-content fallbacks.
3. Audio book/translation downloads still succeed for the audio-only translation and can be replayed offline.
   **Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:

- [x] 05.1-01: Implement and verify audio-only translation download path plus no-text UI behavior

### Phase 13: Public-domain Berean Standard Bible sourcing and direct audio integration

**Goal:** Replace legacy BSB sourcing ambiguity with official public-domain text provenance and direct public BSB audio so the built-in English experience no longer depends on private audio credentials.
**Requirements**: READ-01, AUDIO-03, AUDIO-04
**Depends on:** Phase 12
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The app's built-in BSB translation points at official Berean public-domain terms for text and direct public MP3 chapter audio for playback/downloads.
2. BSB chapter audio can stream and download without `EXPO_PUBLIC_BIBLE_IS_API_KEY`, matching the app's existing public-source WEB approach.
3. Switching from one playable translation to another on the same chapter hands off the active audio session correctly instead of reusing stale playback state.
4. The repo documents a clean follow-up path for refreshing bundled BSB text artifacts from official Berean downloads instead of opaque local source files.
   **Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:

- [x] 13-01: Replace BSB runtime audio dependency with direct public-source chapter MP3s and normalize licensing/docs
- [ ] 13-02: Replace the BSB text refresh pipeline with official Berean download sources and regenerate bundled artifacts

### Phase 14: Backend-driven Bible content sync and offline pack delivery

**Goal:** Let the mobile app discover backend-managed Bible translations online, stream them immediately when needed, and install verified text/audio packs that remain fully usable offline.
**Requirements**: READ-01, READ-02, AUDIO-03, MULTI-01
**Depends on:** Phase 13
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The app can fetch a runtime translation catalog from the backend and show remotely provisioned translations without breaking current bundled BSB/WEB behavior.
2. A translation can be installed as a verified versioned SQLite text pack plus downloadable audio assets, then read, searched, and played fully offline.
3. Failed downloads, bad signatures/checksums, interrupted installs, and stale updates never replace the last known good local pack.
4. Backgrounded downloads reattach cleanly on resume/app restart and surface honest progress, retry, and failure states in the Bible UI.
   **Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 14-01: Define the runtime catalog, signed manifest verification, and background download foundation
- [ ] 14-02: Build the versioned SQLite text-pack registry, install flow, and rollback-safe query routing
- [ ] 14-03: Replace hardcoded audio providers with backend-driven sources and resilient offline/background audio downloads
- [ ] 14-04: Ship translation install/update UX, verification coverage, and release/device QA for the new content platform

### Phase 15: Reverential Theme & Typography

**Goal:** Replace the current generic "tech app" visual language with a reverential, typographically disciplined aesthetic. Strip AI-generated UI patterns (excessive rounded corners, shadows/glows, nested cards, system sans-serif) and replace with warm tones, custom bundled serif font, and three theme modes (Dark, Light, Low-light/Sepia). Apply the new design language across all individual screens.
**Depends on:** Phase 14
**Requirements**: M2-DESIGN-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The app uses warm-toned color palettes across three theme modes (Dark primary, Light, Low-light/Sepia) instead of the current cool blue-grey palette with coral accent.
2. A custom bundled serif font replaces system serif for reading surfaces and extends into the typographic hierarchy where appropriate, with accent color reserved strictly for interactive affordances.
3. Generic UI patterns (excessive rounded corners, drop shadows/glows, nested cards, decorative color) are stripped across all screens and replaced with spacing, dividers, and typographic hierarchy.
4. All hardcoded colors are migrated to theme tokens and every screen in the app adopts the new visual language without changing layouts, navigation, or feature logic.
   **Plans:** 3 plans

Plans:

- [ ] 15-01-PLAN.md — Build reverential design foundation: three warm palettes, bundled Lora serif, print-editorial tokens, three-way theme selector
- [ ] 15-02-PLAN.md — Apply reverential visual language to Home, Bible browser/reader, audio components, and tab bar
- [ ] 15-03-PLAN.md — Complete screen sweep across Learn, More, auth, onboarding, and visual verification

### Phase 16: Backend Foundation & Theme Fix

**Goal:** Fix the low-light theme sync bug, create Supabase storage buckets (avatars, group-images, study-materials) with RLS policies, and add a user_devices table for push notification token storage. Quick backend wins that unblock subsequent feature phases.
**Requirements**: SYNC-01, PREF-01, INFRA-01
**Depends on:** Phase 15
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The `user_preferences.theme` CHECK constraint allows `'low-light'` so the reverential theme syncs correctly without silent data loss.
2. Storage buckets exist for avatars, group images, and study materials with user-scoped and group-scoped RLS policies.
3. A `user_devices` table stores push notification tokens per device, ready for notification delivery in a future phase.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 16 to break down)

### Phase 17: Bookmarks, Highlights & Notes

**Goal:** Add verse-level annotations (bookmarks, highlights with color, freeform notes) with offline-first storage and bidirectional Supabase sync, enabling the core Bible study features users expect from a scripture app.
**Requirements**: STUDY-01, SYNC-01
**Depends on:** Phase 16
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Users can bookmark, highlight (with color selection), and add notes to individual verses or verse ranges in the Bible reader.
2. Annotations persist locally (offline-first) and sync bidirectionally with Supabase using additive merge (never losing annotations from either side).
3. Users can view, filter, and search their annotations from a dedicated annotations list screen.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 17 to break down)

### Phase 18: Reading Plans

**Depends on:** Phase 17
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Users can browse available reading plans, enroll in a plan, and track daily completion with streak and progress indicators.
2. Pre-seeded plans (M'Cheyne, Chronological Bible, Gospels & Epistles, etc.) are available from first launch, sourced from open-source plan data.
3. Group leaders can assign a reading plan to their group, and group members see shared progress.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 18 to break down)

### Phase 19: Prayer Community

**Goal:** Add group-scoped prayer request walls where members can submit prayer requests, mark prayers as answered, and interact with "prayed" and "encouraged" responses, building community within existing study groups.
**Requirements**: GROUP-01, COMMUNITY-01
**Depends on:** Phase 18
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Group members can submit prayer requests (max 500 chars) visible to all members of that group.
2. Members can interact with requests via "prayed" and "encouraged" actions, with counts visible on each request.
3. Request creators can mark prayers as answered, and only creators or group leaders can delete requests.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 19 to break down)

### Phase 20: Analytics & Engagement Metrics

**Goal:** Add lightweight client-side event tracking with server-side aggregation via Supabase Edge Functions, providing user-facing engagement metrics (reading stats, streaks, listening time, engagement score) and a foundation for admin insights.
**Requirements**: ENG-01, INFRA-01
**Depends on:** Phase 19
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. The app emits standardized analytics events (chapter_opened, audio_played, plan_day_completed, etc.) that batch locally and flush to Supabase on sync intervals.
2. A daily Edge Function cron aggregates events into per-user engagement summaries (chapters read, listening minutes, streak, engagement score 0-100).
3. Users can see their engagement metrics in an enhanced profile/stats surface with meaningful reading and listening insights.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 20 to break down)

### Phase 21: Content Versioning & Multiple Translations

**Goal:** Extend Phase 14's translation catalog with version tracking, user translation preferences (primary, secondary, audio), and a data sourcing pipeline from scrollmapper/bible_databases (MIT, 140+ translations) to expand the app's available Bible translations beyond BSB and WEB.
**Requirements**: MULTI-01, READ-01
**Depends on:** Phase 20
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):

1. Translation content has version tracking so updates can be delivered and applied without breaking existing installed packs.
2. Users can set primary, secondary (for future comparison mode), and audio translation preferences that sync across devices.
3. At least 5 additional public-domain translations (ASV, KJV, YLT, BBE + one non-English) are importable through the Phase 14 pack system using scrollmapper data.
   **Plans:** 0 plans

Plans:
- [ ] TBD (run /gsd:plan-phase 21 to break down)

### Phase 22: Gather Tab — Waha-style Foundations, Topics & Meeting Format
