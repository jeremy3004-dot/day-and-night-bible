# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** When someone opens the app, they can reliably read or listen to scripture and continue their discipleship journey even when network conditions are weak or backend features are partially unavailable.
**Current focus:** Phase 30 — animated-chapter-swipe-and-reader-gestures

## Current Position

Phase: 30
Phase: 30 (animated-chapter-swipe-and-reader-gestures) — NEXT

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 32

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Treat this as a brownfield hardening roadmap, not a greenfield project
- Initialization: Keep Expo / React Native / Supabase and plan improvements incrementally
- Initialization: Use standard-granularity phases with parallel execution and verification enabled
- Phase 2: Treat locale flow as verification-heavy because the core flow already exists; spend implementation effort on privacy/settings parity and reminder correctness
- Phase 3: Expose local Bible search through the live browser instead of adding a separate search screen or data path
- Phase 3: Gate audio affordances by real remote-or-offline capability rather than by translation metadata alone
- Phase 4: Mount the existing LearnStack directly in the root shell before attempting deeper discipleship or group rewrites
- Phase 4: Use a read-side group repository boundary so preserved local groups stay usable while synced groups remain honest about rollout status
- Phase 4: Route synced session completion through explicit service guards instead of letting remote groups fall through local-only mutation paths
- Phase 05.1: Add a dedicated audio-only translation path so the app can be validated when audio exists but chapter text does not
- Phase 6: Keep passage parsing inline with the existing Bible search entry point instead of adding a separate scripture-jump screen
- Phase 6: Treat the calendar as a reading-activity view backed by current progress data, not a full reading-plan system
- Phase 6: Migrate only the highest-value Bible lists to FlashList first and preserve existing reader/audio contracts
- Phase 7: Use one chapter screen with explicit session-mode helpers rather than splitting listen and read into separate routes
- Phase 8: Use a local-first book experience contract with seeded metadata and original fallback visuals instead of blocking on a backend content source
- Phase 9: Keep saved-library features local-first and extend the existing audio store/player contract rather than introducing a new playback architecture
- Phase 10: Attach companion modules to the book hub through one reusable schema and a thin analytics seam instead of adding a CMS or vendor analytics dependency first
- Post-phase polish: Keep completion context in the chapter grid, but remove the large hero progress card from the book hub because it competes with the actual reader/listener surfaces
- Post-phase polish: Treat chapter-to-chapter audio navigation as a single-session handoff and cancel stale chapter loads instead of letting multiple playback requests race
- Post-phase polish: Let the player own chapter transport inside BibleReader, hide the global tab shell on that route, and use the freed vertical space for a fuller listen/audio-first layout
- Post-phase polish: Only resync BibleReader to the active audio chapter when the reader was already showing that playing chapter; manual chapter launches must override stale playback state
- Post-phase polish: Keep the book hub focused on title plus chapter grid, removing extra explanatory and promotional chrome that competes with the actual reading/listening action
- Post-phase polish: Treat the audio-first Bible screen as a dedicated minimal listen surface with its own stripped header and transport variant instead of reusing the fuller reader chrome
- Post-phase polish: Keep the Listen/Read toggle exclusive to the actual chapter session screen, and keep book-hub hero banners on the shared accent red instead of rotating per-book colors
- Phase 11: Reuse the existing playback/session model, but give audio-first chapters a dedicated chapter-only transport and art-led layout instead of stacking extra shells and explanatory copy
- Phase 12: Prefer a disciplined mobile system built around structured native sans typography, 4-point spacing rhythm, and semantic surfaces rather than adding more decorative treatments or screen-specific visual experiments
- Phase 13 hardening: Treat translation identity as part of audio track identity so BSB and WEB playback, queue entries, and resume state cannot collide on the same chapter
- Phase 27: Co-locate all bundled translations in a single bible-bsb-v2.db asset rather than per-translation files; downloadTranslation resolves silently for hasText translations; TranslationBrowserScreen uses useBibleStore.getState() inside callbacks to avoid reactive re-trigger loops
- [Phase 28-multi-translation-supabase-library]: bible_verses schema mirrors bundled SQLite verses table 1:1 so download data maps cleanly to local DB format
- [Phase 28-multi-translation-supabase-library]: anon RLS policies added to all three translation tables so unauthenticated users can browse without requiring login
- [Phase 28-multi-translation-supabase-library]: Import script uses service_role key (bypasses RLS) and is a dev/ops tool only — not called from the app
- [Phase 28]: Use expo-file-system/legacy for cloudTranslationService filesystem ops; new v2 API does not expose documentDirectory on its top-level namespace
- [Phase 28]: Fetch Supabase bible_verses in pages of 5000 to respect free-tier response size limits
- [Phase 28]: Dynamic import() of cloudTranslationService in bibleStore to keep bundled-only app startup lean
- [Phase 29-mmkv-state-persistence-upgrade]: Pin react-native-mmkv to 2.12.2 (no caret) — prevents accidental v3 install which requires New Architecture and crashes on newArchEnabled=false builds
- [Phase 29-mmkv-state-persistence-upgrade]: Use dynamic require() in migrateFromAsyncStorage for native deps so STORE_KEYS and migrateStoreKeys can be imported in Node test runner without native module resolution
- [Phase 29-mmkv-state-persistence-upgrade P02]: QueryClientProvider placed as outermost provider in App() — wraps all other providers so future useQuery hooks work regardless of which provider tree they sit in
- [Phase 29-mmkv-state-persistence-upgrade P02]: No Supabase calls migrated in this plan — additive foundation only; existing fetch patterns untouched
- [Phase 30-animated-chapter-swipe P01]: Pin react-native-reanimated to ~3.19.5 explicitly — npx expo install without a pin resolves to 4.x which requires New Architecture and crashes on newArchEnabled=false builds
- [Phase 30-animated-chapter-swipe P01]: Place swipe threshold constants and resolveSwipeChapterNavigation in bibleReaderModel.ts alongside existing reader model constants — keeps the model surface cohesive and avoids a new file for a small addition

### Pending Todos

- Manual device verification for Phase 05.1 WEB audio translation selection, download, and offline playback behavior
- Manual verification for typed references like `John 3:16`, `1 Cor 13`, and `Luke 10:5-7, 10-11` from the Bible surface
- Manual verification for ChapterSelector and BibleBrowser FlashList behavior on device, especially scroll feel and layout stability
- Manual verification for the Reading Activity screen from More/Profile, including marked days and selected-day detail behavior
- Translation pass for the new reading-activity strings; non-English locales currently use English fallback copy to preserve key coverage
- Manual verification for the new Phase 7 listen/read segmented session, including overlay open/close, playback continuity, and read-mode return behavior
- Manual device verification for the new book hub hero, synopsis, intro strip, continue CTA, and chapter grid across smaller phones
- Manual verification for saved-library flows, including favorites, playlist save/reopen, queue advancement, history reopen, and share/download behavior
- Manual verification for reader chapter navigation while audio is already playing, especially repeated `Next`/`Previous` taps and mixed read/listen mode transitions
- Manual verification for opening a different chapter from the chapter list while another chapter is already playing, ensuring the new chapter starts immediately instead of snapping back
- Manual verification for the global mini-player across tabs, app background/foreground transitions, and reopen/dismiss behavior
- Manual verification for companion-module sections, including sparse-book empty states and return navigation back into the book hub or chapter session
- Manual device verification for the full-screen BibleReader chrome, especially hidden tabs, audio-only chapter spacing, and read/listen mode bottom insets on smaller phones
- Manual device verification for the simplified book hub on smaller phones, ensuring the reduced hero still balances cleanly above the chapter grid
- Manual device verification that simplified book hubs no longer show the top Listen/Read rail, no longer show the empty companion fallback card, and keep the same accent-red hero background across books
- Manual device verification that chapter tiles no longer show completion check badges and still keep the intended continue-chapter highlight
- Manual device verification for the new simplified audio-first listen screen, especially header removal, three-button transport spacing, and overflow/favorite actions on smaller iPhones
- Manual device verification that the top audio toggle/button remains discoverable enough on text chapters now that audio-first chapters no longer show duplicate top chrome
- Manual device verification for the new Phase 12 professional design system, especially tab-bar fit, card density, and title hierarchy across Home, Bible, Learn, More, Profile, and Reading Activity
- Manual device verification for the new Phase 12.1 premium read-mode chrome, especially scroll-collapse timing, glass legibility, and safe-area fit on smaller iPhones
- Manual device verification that built-in BSB audio still streams, downloads, switches cleanly from an already-playing WEB chapter, and plays offline correctly after the direct-source swap away from Bible.is
- Plan 13-02: replace the older local BSB text refresh path with an official Berean download/import pipeline and regenerate bundled BSB artifacts from first-party files

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 still needs manual device validation for startup, auth callbacks, and reconnect sync
- Phase 2 still needs manual device validation for locale completion, discreet-mode relock, and reminder delivery
- Phase 3 still needs manual device validation for offline search, daily audio CTA behavior, and remote-vs-offline audio transitions
- Phase 4 still needs manual device validation for Harvest-tab navigation, local-vs-synced group flows, and synced session completion
- Signed builds, device checks, and distribution attachment still need manual verification before the milestone can be called shipped
- Phase 05.1 now uses direct eBible.org WEB audio and still needs manual device verification for in-app download/offline playback behavior
- Phase 6 adds new dependencies (`@shopify/flash-list`, `react-native-calendars`, `bible-passage-reference-parser`) that need verification against current Expo / React Native runtime behavior
- Dwell-style follow-along text currently uses weighted progress estimation because the current audio layer does not expose uniform verse-level timing metadata
- Phases 8 to 10 ship with local-first seeded metadata and companion content; any future backend source now needs only to implement the existing contracts rather than redefining the UI layer
- Gstack/browser verification remains intentionally skipped for the new Bible flows because the repo does not include Expo web dependencies and the shipped surfaces are native-first
- Phase 11 now depends on device QA for visual fit on smaller iPhones because the new art-led listen layout intentionally uses more vertical space and fewer header affordances
- Phase 12 improves the main impression surfaces first; deeper edge screens such as full settings flows may still benefit from a second-pass polish after device review
- Phase 12.1 depends on a credible React Native approximation of Apple's liquid-glass feel; Expo blur and motion tuning must improve the experience without making controls unreadable or brittle on device
- Phase 12.1 is now in TestFlight as App Store Connect build `100` (`aa288850-2023-4ff4-817f-a071af783fd1`), with `processingState=VALID`, `group_has_build=true`, and `tester_has_build=true` for `curryj@protonmail.com`
- Phase 13 still needs device QA for BSB translation-switch handoff, download, and offline playback after the direct-source provider swap, and plan 02 still needs to replace the older local BSB text refresh path with official Berean downloads
