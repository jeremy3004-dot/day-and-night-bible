# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** When someone opens the app, they can reliably read or listen to scripture and continue their discipleship journey even when network conditions are weak or backend features are partially unavailable.
**Current focus:** Manual device verification for urgent Phase 05.1 audio-only/no-text behavior before release follow-through

## Current Position

Phase: 05.1 (Audio-only downloadable Bible experience)
Plan: 1 of 1 in current phase
Status: Plan implemented and verified in automation; awaiting manual device verification
Last activity: 2026-03-14 — Executed Phase 05.1 plan 01 with passing tests, lint, and updated phase summary

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: n/a (first execution session)
- Total execution time: n/a

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Startup And Backend Hardening | 2 | n/a | n/a |
| 2. Onboarding And Preference Cohesion | 2 | n/a | n/a |
| 3. Core Reading And Audio Polish | 2 | n/a | n/a |
| 4. Discipleship And Group Rollout | 3 | n/a | n/a |
| 5. Release Hardening And Distribution | 2 | n/a | n/a |
| 05.1 Audio-only downloadable Bible experience | 1 | n/a | n/a |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 04-01, 04-02, 04-03, 05-01, 05-02
- Trend: Stable execution plus urgent scope insertion for no-text audio Bible validation

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Treat this as a brownfield hardening roadmap, not a greenfield project
- Initialization: Keep Expo / React Native / Supabase and plan improvements incrementally
- Initialization: Use standard-granularity phases with parallel execution and verification enabled
- Phase 2: Treat locale flow as verification-heavy because the core flow already exists; spend implementation effort on privacy/settings parity and reminder correctness
- Phase 3: Expose local Bible search through the live browser instead of adding a separate search screen or data path
- Phase 3: Gate audio affordances by real remote-or-offline capability rather than by translation metadata alone
- Phase 4: Mount the existing LearnStack directly in the root shell before attempting deeper discipleship or group rewrites
- Phase 4: Use a read-side group repository boundary so preserved local groups stay usable while synced groups remain honest about rollout status
- Phase 4: Route synced session completion through explicit service guards instead of letting remote groups fall through local-only mutation paths
- Phase 05.1: Add a dedicated audio-only translation path so the app can be validated when audio exists but chapter text does not

### Pending Todos

- Manual device verification for Phase 05.1 audio-only translation selection, download, and offline playback behavior

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 05.1 inserted after Phase 5: Audio-only downloadable Bible experience (URGENT)

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 still needs manual device validation for startup, auth callbacks, and reconnect sync
- Phase 2 still needs manual device validation for locale completion, discreet-mode relock, and reminder delivery
- Phase 3 still needs manual device validation for offline search, daily audio CTA behavior, and remote-vs-offline audio transitions
- Phase 4 still needs manual device validation for Harvest-tab navigation, local-vs-synced group flows, and synced session completion
- Signed builds, device checks, and distribution attachment still need manual verification before the milestone can be called shipped
- Phase 05.1 still needs manual device verification for audio-only translation download and offline playback behavior

## Session Continuity
