# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added:
    - react-native-mmkv@2.12.2 (pinned — v2 required for newArchEnabled=false)
  patterns:
    - Single shared MMKV instance for all 7 stores (one mmap file, each store keyed by persist name)
    - zustandStorage adapter: StateStorage wrapper over MMKV v2 API (.set/.getString/.delete)
    - migrateStoreKeys accepts injected deps for Node test runner compatibility (no native imports at module level)
    - Dynamic require() in migrateFromAsyncStorage to prevent native module loading during tests

    - src/stores/mmkvStorage.test.ts
    - src/stores/migrateFromAsyncStorage.ts

    - src/services/startup/startupService.ts
    - src/screens/more/SettingsScreen.tsx
    - App.tsx
    - package.json
    - package-lock.json

key-decisions:
  - "Pin react-native-mmkv to 2.12.2 (not ^2.12.2) — prevents accidental v3 install which breaks old arch"
  - "Use dynamic require() in migrateFromAsyncStorage for native deps so migrateStoreKeys can be imported in Node test runner without native module resolution"
  - "Export migrateStoreKeys with injected deps (not the real function) for testability — tests never load AsyncStorage or MMKV native modules"
  - "Keep AsyncStorage calls in SettingsScreen alongside MMKV calls — some users may still have legacy AsyncStorage data from before migration"

patterns-established:
  - "zustandStorage: StateStorage pattern — shared MMKV instance + 3-method adapter used by all persisted stores"
  - "MMKV v2 uses .delete() not .remove() — v4 renamed this; do not use .remove() in v2 code"
  - "migrateStoreKeys(keys, getAsync, getMmkv, setMmkv) — testable migration loop with injected native deps"

# Phase 29 Plan 01: MMKV State Persistence Upgrade Summary

**react-native-mmkv@2.12.2 replaces AsyncStorage across all 7 Zustand stores with a shared JSI adapter, one-time migration preserves existing user data, and SettingsScreen cache/delete flows updated for MMKV**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 7 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-25T01:24:12Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-25T01:30:57Z
- **Tasks:** 2 of 3 (Task 3 is human-verify checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 13 (plus 5 new files)

## Accomplishments

- Installed and pinned react-native-mmkv@2.12.2 (last v2 release, compatible with newArchEnabled=false)
- Created shared mmkvStorage.ts adapter exporting zustandStorage (StateStorage) and mmkvInstance (MMKV)
- Created migrateFromAsyncStorage.ts with idempotent 7-key migration, testable via injected deps
- Swapped AsyncStorage for zustandStorage in all 7 persisted stores (authStore, bibleStore, audioStore, progressStore, fourFieldsStore, gatherStore, libraryStore)
- Wired migrateFromAsyncStorage into createStartupCoordinator as optional migrateStorage dependency, called before auth/privacy init
- Updated SettingsScreen cache clear to selectively delete non-preserved MMKV keys, account delete to clearAll MMKV
- 10 new unit tests pass; 62 existing release regression tests still pass; TypeScript clean

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: Install MMKV, create storage adapter, migration helper, and tests** - `7d319f3` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Swap all 7 stores to MMKV, wire migration into startup, update SettingsScreen** - `4eccd04` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Dev build and device verification** - CHECKPOINT (pending human verification)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/stores/mmkvStorage.ts` - Shared MMKV instance and Zustand StateStorage adapter
- `src/stores/mmkvStorage.test.ts` - 4 adapter contract tests using Map-based mock
- `src/stores/migrateFromAsyncStorage.ts` - One-time AsyncStorage-to-MMKV migration with exported testable core
- `src/stores/migrateFromAsyncStorage.test.ts` - 5 migration logic tests using injected deps
- `src/stores/__tests__/mmkvMock.ts` - Reusable Map-backed MMKV mock for Node test runner
- `src/stores/{authStore,bibleStore,audioStore,progressStore,fourFieldsStore,gatherStore,libraryStore}.ts` - AsyncStorage swapped to zustandStorage
- `src/stores/index.ts` - Added zustandStorage/mmkvInstance exports
- `src/services/startup/startupService.ts` - Added migrateStorage optional dependency, called before auth/privacy
- `src/screens/more/SettingsScreen.tsx` - MMKV clearing in cache clear and account delete handlers
- `App.tsx` - Import and pass migrateFromAsyncStorage to startup coordinator
- `package.json` - react-native-mmkv@2.12.2 (pinned, no caret)

## Decisions Made

- Pinned react-native-mmkv to `2.12.2` (not `^2.12.2`) — caret would allow v3 install on `npm update` which requires New Architecture and would crash on old arch builds
- Used `dynamic require()` inside `migrateFromAsyncStorage()` function body (not static import) to prevent native module loading when tests import `STORE_KEYS` or `migrateStoreKeys` — this is the key pattern that makes the migration helper testable in Node test runner
- Kept `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` installed — removal would require auditing the full dependency tree and is out of scope; it's still used in SettingsScreen alongside MMKV for legacy key cleanup

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Fixed TypeScript strict type error in migration test**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (verification phase — npm run typecheck)
- **Issue:** `STORE_KEYS.includes(key)` where `key: string` fails strict TS because `STORE_KEYS` is `readonly ("auth-storage" | ...)[]` and includes() only accepts the exact union type
- **Fix:** Cast to `readonly string[]` before calling includes in the test: `(STORE_KEYS as readonly string[]).includes(key)`
- **Files modified:** src/stores/migrateFromAsyncStorage.test.ts
- **Verification:** tsc --noEmit passes cleanly
- **Committed in:** 4eccd04 (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 missing critical — TypeScript strict compliance)
**Impact on plan:** Required change for TypeScript strict mode compliance. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered

- Initial approach used static `import AsyncStorage from '...'` in `migrateFromAsyncStorage.ts` which caused the Node test runner to fail when loading the migration module (react-native bridge transforms). Resolved by moving the native imports to dynamic `require()` inside the async function body, so the module's exports (`STORE_KEYS`, `migrateStoreKeys`) can be imported without triggering native module loading.
- `eslint-disable` comments for `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` added initially but flagged as "unused directive" — removed them since the rule wasn't active in this context.

## Known Stubs

None — all wiring is complete. MMKV reads are synchronous, so cold-start hydration lag is eliminated for stores. The migration runs at startup before stores initialize. No placeholder values or deferred data sources in the implementation.

## User Setup Required

None — no external service configuration required. However, a new dev build is required before testing on device since MMKV is a native C++ module that does not work in Expo Go.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Tasks 1 and 2 complete — all code changes committed and verified
- Task 3 (checkpoint:human-verify) requires a new dev build to test on iOS/Android simulator
- After Task 3 approval: plan is complete, move to Phase 29 Plan 02 (TanStack Query, if executed)
- MMKV migration is transparent to all downstream code — stores have the same Zustand interface, only the persistence backend changed
