# Tibetan Illustrations Project Summary

**Project:** Day and Night Bible App - Culturally Appropriate Tibetan Illustration Assets
**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** Ready for External Generation

---

## Project Overview

This project prepares all necessary documentation, tooling, and workflows to generate 7 culturally appropriate Tibetan-style illustrations for the Day and Night Bible mobile app's field tracking journey feature.

### Why This Approach?

Direct AI image generation tools (Midjourney, DALL-E, Gemini Imagen) are not available in this development environment. Therefore, this project provides:

1. **Complete generation prompts** ready to copy/paste into external services
2. **Cultural review framework** to ensure appropriateness
3. **Processing automation** to create multi-resolution variants
4. **React Native integration** examples for immediate use

## Workflow Summary

### Phase 1: External Generation (You Are Here)

1. **Choose AI service:**
   - Midjourney (recommended for quality)
   - DALL-E 3 (via ChatGPT Plus)
   - Leonardo.ai (free tier available)
   - Adobe Firefly (commercial licensing)

2. **Generate 7 images:**
   - Copy prompts from `IMAGE_GENERATION_PROMPTS.md`
   - Generate each image at 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Review for cultural appropriateness
   - Download and rename to exact filenames

3. **Save to originals directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p originals
   # Move downloaded images here
   ```

### Phase 2: Cultural Review

1. Open `cultural-review-checklist.md`
2. Review each image systematically
3. Check for prohibited elements
4. Document any needed revisions
5. Regenerate if necessary

### Phase 3: Processing

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   brew install imagemagick optipng
   ```

2. Run processing script:
   ```bash
   ./process-images.sh
   ```

3. Verify output:
   - 21 files generated (7 images × 3 resolutions)
   - @1x files under 500KB each
   - All images maintain 16:9 aspect ratio

### Phase 4: Integration

1. Import in React Native:
   ```typescript
   import { TibetanIllustration } from './assets/tibetan/TibetanIllustrationExample';

   <TibetanIllustration asset="homeHero" />
   ```

2. Test on devices:
   - iOS (verify @2x/@3x selection)
   - Android (verify @2x/@3x selection)
   - Performance monitoring

3. Deploy to production

| **ChatGPT Plus** | $20/mo | ~50 per 3hrs | Cultural accuracy |
| **Leonardo.ai Free** | $0 | 150/day | Budget testing |
| **Adobe Firefly** | $4.99/mo | 100 | Commercial rights |

**Recommendation for this project:**
- Start with Leonardo.ai free tier for testing

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Image has prohibited elements

**Solution:**
1. Regenerate with stronger prohibition in prompt
2. Add negative prompt: "buddhist idols, tibetan flags, religious symbols"
3. Review cultural guidelines and adjust prompt

### Problem: Wrong aspect ratio

**Solution:**
1. Check generation settings (must be 16:9)
2. Crop to 16:9 before processing
3. Regenerate with explicit `--ar 16:9` flag (Midjourney)

### Problem: File size too large

**Solution:**
1. Run additional compression:
   ```bash
   pngquant --quality=80-95 image.png -o image-compressed.png
   ```
2. Use online tools: TinyPNG.com, Squoosh.app
3. Consider WebP format for better compression

### Problem: Style inconsistency between images

**Solution:**
1. Generate all images in same session
2. Use style reference feature (Midjourney `--sref`)
3. Add "consistent Procreate illustration style" to all prompts
4. Regenerate outliers

### Problem: Processing script fails

**Solution:**
1. Verify ImageMagick installed: `convert --version`
2. Check file permissions: `chmod +x process-images.sh`
3. Ensure originals/ directory exists and has images
4. Check image filenames match exactly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **WebP variants** for better compression
2. **Dark mode versions** with adjusted color palettes
3. **SVG overlays** for interactive elements
4. **Animated versions** for loading states
5. **Additional field stages** as app evolves

### Localization Considerations
If app expands to other cultural contexts:
- Nepali illustrations
- Bhutanese illustrations
- Mongolian illustrations
- Indian Himalayan regions

Use this project as template for future illustration sets.
