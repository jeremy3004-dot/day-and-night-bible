# "1 Field 1 Goal" Content Structure for Day and Night Bible

## Overview

Based on research, "One Field One Goal" is the foundational approach for Harvest Multiplication Training (HMT) at multipliers.info. Since the website is CDN-protected, this document proposes an adaptation based on:

1. **Research findings:** HMT consists of 3 modules focused on making disciple-makers (not just disciples)
2. **Reference design:** Indonesian Muslim-focused Bible study app showing culturally adapted content
3. **Existing structure:** Current Four Fields implementation (5 fields)

## Proposed Adaptation: "1 Field 1 Goal" for Tibet

### Philosophy Shift

**Current (Four Fields):**
- 5 sequential fields: Entry → Gospel → Discipleship → Church → Multiplication
- Broad discipleship journey

**New (1 Field 1 Goal):**
- Focus on ONE field at a time with ONE clear goal
- Each field is a complete cycle of: Learn → Practice → Teach
- Simpler, more focused approach suitable for new believers

### Structure: 3 Core Fields

export interface OneFieldGoalLesson {
  id: string;
  field: OneFieldGoalFieldType;
  order: number;

  emoji: string;
  color: string; // Tibetan palette color
  goal: string; // Single clear goal for the field
  completionCriteria: string[];

}
```

### UI Changes from Four Fields

**Current Journey Screen:**

- All fields visible at once
- Complex progress tracking

**New "1 Field 1 Goal" Screen:**
- Shows only CURRENT field as hero card
- Completed fields shown as small cards below
- Locked fields grayed out with "Complete Field X first" message
- Simpler: Focus on ONE thing at a time

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  CURRENT FIELD              │
│  ┌───────────────────────┐  │
│  │ [Field 2 Image]       │  │

│  │ Goal: Help one person │  │
│  │       grow in faith   │  │
│  │                       │  │
│  │ ▓▓▓▓░░░ 4/9 lessons  │  │
│  │ [Continue Button]     │  │
│  └───────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────┘

Completed:
┌──────────────┐

└──────────────┘

Next:
┌──────────────┐
│ 🔒 Field 3   │  (locked, grayed)
│ Complete     │
│ Field 2 first│
└──────────────┘
```

### Content Adaptation Notes

**Tibetan Cultural Bridges:**
- **Prayer flags:** Use as metaphor for sins carried away (like wind carries prayers)
- **Guru-disciple tradition:** Natural entry point for mentoring concept
- **Family lineage:** Use for multiplication/spiritual family tree
- **Pilgrimage:** Journey metaphor for discipleship
- **Monastery community:** Model for church/fellowship
- **Butter lamps:** Light passing from one to another (multiplication)

**Avoid:**
- Buddhist religious terms (dharma, karma, samsara) - use Christian equivalents
- Reincarnation concepts - emphasize new life, not rebirth
- Idol/statue imagery - focus on people and relationships
- Temple worship - focus on personal relationship with God

**Emphasize:**
- Oral tradition (Tibetans love stories)
- Community and relationships (collectivist culture)
- Practical obedience (action-oriented)
- Passing on to others (family/lineage focus)

## Migration from Four Fields

### State Migration Strategy

Users who have progress in the current Four Fields system need smooth transition:

```typescript
interface MigrationMap {
  // Old Four Fields → New 1 Field 1 Goal
  'entry': 'good-news',        // Maps to Field 1
  'gospel': 'good-news',       // Combines with entry
  'discipleship': 'making-disciples', // Maps to Field 2
  'church': 'multiplication',   // Part of Field 3
  'multiplication': 'multiplication' // Maps to Field 3
}

function migrateProgress(oldProgress: FourFieldsProgress): OneFieldGoalProgress {
  // If user completed Entry OR Gospel → Field 1 complete
  // If user completed Discipleship → Field 2 in progress
  // If user completed Church OR Multiplication → Field 3 in progress

  // Preserve lesson completion data where applicable
  // Show migration notice to user explaining new structure
}
```

### User Communication

**In-app message after update:**
```
🎉 New Simplified Training!

We've updated the Harvest section with a clearer, more focused approach:

OLD: 5 Fields (Entry → Gospel → Discipleship → Church → Multiplication)
NEW: 3 Fields (Good News → Making Disciples → Multiplication)

Your progress has been preserved. Each field now has ONE clear goal to help you focus on what matters most: making disciples who make disciples.

[Start Field 1] [Learn More]
```

## Success Metrics

How to measure if "1 Field 1 Goal" is working better than Four Fields:

1. **Completion Rate:** % of users who complete all 3 fields vs old 5 fields
2. **Time to Complete:** Average weeks to finish the journey
3. **Engagement:** Daily/weekly active usage of Learn section
4. **Practical Application:** % who check off "practiced" and "taught" items
5. **Multiplication:** # of users reporting 3+ generations

**Expected Improvements:**
- Higher completion rate (3 fields easier than 5)
- Clearer goals (actionable vs theoretical)
- More focus (one thing at a time)
- Better cultural fit (adapted to Tibetan context)
