# TestFlight Build Visibility Playbook

Use this when a build has uploaded, but testers still cannot see it in TestFlight.

## 1. Confirm the build is actually in App Store Connect

```bash
asc builds list --app <new-app-store-id> --sort -uploadedDate --limit 10 --output json
```

Check:
- the build number is present
- `processingState` is `VALID`
- `usesNonExemptEncryption` is `false`

If the build is not present, this is an upload/build issue, not a TestFlight distribution issue.

## 2. Confirm export compliance is not the blocker

This app already declares non-exempt encryption as false in:
- `/Users/dev/Projects/Day and Night Bible/app.json`

Relevant setting:

```json
"ios": {
  "infoPlist": {
    "ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption": false
  }
}
```

If ASC shows `usesNonExemptEncryption=false`, export compliance is already satisfied for that build.

## 3. Check TestFlight beta state

```bash
asc testflight beta-details get --build BUILD_ID --output json
```

Interpretation:
- `internalBuildState=READY_FOR_BETA_TESTING`
  - build can be used internally, but may still need to be attached to testers/groups
- `externalBuildState=READY_FOR_BETA_SUBMISSION`
  - external testers will not see it yet
- `externalBuildState=IN_BETA_TESTING`
  - external review/distribution is active

## 4. Check whether the build is attached to the correct beta groups

List groups:

```bash
asc testflight beta-groups list --app <new-app-store-id> --output json
```

Check group build relationships:

```bash
asc testflight beta-groups relationships get --group-id GROUP_ID --type builds --paginate --output json
```

For this app:
- Internal Testers: `3a75b4d5-cae0-4c9a-8880-890f486f605a`
- External Testers: `f32e3138-d64b-4d40-9337-18a3a9096010`

## 5. Attach the build to the intended groups

```bash
asc builds add-groups --build BUILD_ID --group INTERNAL_GROUP_ID,EXTERNAL_GROUP_ID
```

Example used for build `113`:

```bash
asc builds add-groups \
  --build fc5b0cee-1e9e-41a1-b02f-3c89654c3889 \
  --group 3a75b4d5-cae0-4c9a-8880-890f486f605a,f32e3138-d64b-4d40-9337-18a3a9096010
```

## 6. Add a direct tester fallback for internal visibility

If internal visibility is urgent or group state is ambiguous, attach the build directly to the internal tester too.

List testers:

```bash
asc testflight beta-testers list --app <new-app-store-id> --output json
```

Attach build directly:

```bash
asc testflight beta-testers add-builds --id TESTER_ID --build BUILD_ID
```

Example used:

```bash
asc testflight beta-testers add-builds \
  --id e378ad42-c381-460b-9e06-b4180b938807 \
  --build fc5b0cee-1e9e-41a1-b02f-3c89654c3889
```

## 7. Submit the build for external beta review

If external testers cannot see the build and `externalBuildState` is `READY_FOR_BETA_SUBMISSION`, submit it:

```bash
asc testflight review submit --build BUILD_ID --confirm --output json
```

Example used:

```bash
asc testflight review submit \
  --build fc5b0cee-1e9e-41a1-b02f-3c89654c3889 \
  --confirm
```

## 8. Re-verify after repair

Check build beta state again:

```bash
asc testflight beta-details get --build BUILD_ID --output json
```

Check group linkage again:

```bash
asc testflight beta-groups relationships get --group-id GROUP_ID --type builds --paginate --output json
```

Check direct tester linkage again:

```bash
asc testflight beta-testers builds list --tester-id TESTER_ID --output json
```

## Known-good outcome

For build `113`, the repaired state was:
- build ID: `fc5b0cee-1e9e-41a1-b02f-3c89654c3889`
- `processingState=VALID`
- `internalBuildState=IN_BETA_TESTING`
- `externalBuildState=IN_BETA_TESTING`
- attached to `Internal Testers`
- attached to `External Testers`
- directly attached to `curryj@protonmail.com`

## Root cause from this incident

The build was not blocked by export compliance.

The actual issue was:
- the build had uploaded successfully
- export compliance was already satisfied
- but the build was not attached to the needed beta groups/testers
- and external review had not been submitted yet

That combination makes the build look "missing" in TestFlight even though ASC already shows it as a valid build.
